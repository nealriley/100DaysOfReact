## Getting started

First up, you will need to fork this repo, and clone it! 

Next, you will need to install a few things in order to run React locally (and deploy to Github Pages):

* [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) for Windows
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/) or [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) for Windows

You can either use React locally for the earlier (non-React) sections, or use something like CodePen if you prefer. 

Next up, install Node/NPM/Yarn

* Open up a Terminal and type 

    * `nvm install v10.15.3`

    * `nvm use v10.15.3` 

* Then, install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)

You should be able to check out this repository, cd into the folder, and run:

`yarn install`
